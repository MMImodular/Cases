# 9U Studio Case

I drew these files up in Autodesk Inventor 2018 and put together a 3d model before cutting them out. The .ipt files are the source files and if you are wondering about any exact dimensions they are the definitive answer to all your questions. I have uploaded screenshots in the main folder to use as reference if you do not have access to Inventor.

The sketches were exported as .dxf, which is horribly finicky and may not import correctly to your program of choice. I believe these should maintain the right dimensions but it’s worth it to double check

In order to cut the files, I changed the .dxf to .pdf so that I could import them to CorelDraw. **THESE PDFS DO NOT HAVE THE CORRECT DIMENSIONS**. In order to import the pdfs, you must ungroup all the lines, delete the background, and then edit the dimensions of the resulting lines to fit the original. For the side panels, I had to unlock the horizontal and vertical sizing because the PDF changed the aspect ratio a bit. These parts are precision fit, the size does matter down to a point.

A quick way to figure out what if you’ve sized everything correctly is to look at the distance between the holes for the rails. The long gaps should measure exactly 4.741 inches or 12.042 centimeters.

The .cdr files saved from CorelDraw are the files that I cut personally and should be 100% reliable. There are a few quirks like the laser going over some lines multiple times, but they were not significant issues or else I would have fixed them. These files should also contain the “Keep Rockin’ Pusherman” and “Matt Gaines” etchings on them. Do note that when assembled, one of the “Matt Gaines” etchings will be on the interior of the case. I did this unintentionally, but did not want to buy another piece of wood to cut so I left it as is. Feel free to edit the text as you see fit but it would make me happy if you kept my name there. Makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something.

Be sure to post your results on Pusherman or /r/modular! I want to see what designs or edits you guys come up with. You could realistically make this case as long or short as you want, so you could throw in some 400hp rails if you’re so inclined, just gotta edit one dimension in a couple files.
